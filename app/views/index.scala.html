                        Connect Four (also known as Captain's Mistress, Four Up, Plot Four, Find Four, Four in a Row,
                        Four in a Line and Gravitrips (in Soviet Union)) is a two-player connection game in which the
                        players first choose a color and then take turns dropping colored discs from the top into a
                        seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the
                        next available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a
                        horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own discs. Connect Four is a solved
                        game. The first player can always win by playing the right moves. The game was first sold under
                        the Connect Four trademark by Milton Bradley in February 1974.
